This was a website project build for the CS50x course.

## A Poesia da Vida (The Poetry of Life)

### Description:
My idea on the website was to share poetry with other people.
The website contains different pages for each of my favorite authors. 
Furthermore, I also added a section where I share my poems with a voting system. This way I could receive feedback from my friends on the poems I had written.

The site's content is in Portuguese.
